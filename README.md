# FuzzyPotato
The solar-powered an IoT-based system for monitoring environmental conditions using various sensors and transmitting the data to a server with the ESP32 micro-controller unit. (Temperature, Humidity, Illuminance (Lux), Soil Moisture, Soil Salinity, Battery Voltage) The system is designed to operate on an ESP32 microcontroller, utilizing Wi-Fi for connectivity and deep sleep mode for power conservation.

### Features
- **Real-time Sensor Data Collection :** Measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil salinity, light intensity, and battery voltage.
- **Data Transmission :** Sends sensor data to the ThingSpeak server for remote monitoring and analysis.
- **Power Management :** Utilizes deep sleep mode to conserve power and extend battery life.
- **Watchdog Timer :** Ensures system stability and automatic recovery in case of failures.

### Sensors and Components
- **DHT12 Sensor :** Measures temperature and humidity.
- **BH1750 Sensor :** Measures light intensity.
- **Analog Pins :** Measures soil moisture, soil salinity, and battery voltage.
- **Power Control Pin :** Manages the power to the sensors to conserve energy.

### Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** Arduino / ESP32

### Code Structure
- **WiFi Setup :** Connects to the specified Wi-Fi network using provided SSID and password.
- **Sensor Initialization :** Initializes the I2C bus and sensors.
- **Data Collection Functions :** Reads data from each sensor and calculates average values.
- **HTTP POST Request :** Sends collected sensor data to the ThingSpeak server.
- **Deep Sleep Function :** Puts the ESP32 into deep sleep mode to save power between data collection cycles.

#### Functions and Methods
- **`setup()`** : Initializes serial communication, Wi-Fi connection, sensors, and watchdog timer.
- **`loop()`** : Collects sensor data, sends it to the server, and enters deep sleep mode.
- **`sleepGo()`** : Configures and enters deep sleep mode for a specified duration.
- **`readTemp()`** : Reads and averages temperature data from the DHT12 sensor.
- **`readHumi()`** : Reads and averages humidity data from the DHT12 sensor.
- **`readSalt()`** : Reads and averages soil salinity data.
- **`readSoil()`** : Reads and averages soil moisture data.
- **`readLux()`** : Reads and averages light intensity data from the BH1750 sensor.
- **`readBattery()`** : Reads and averages battery voltage data.

#### Example Output
Temperature = 23.45 </br>
Humidity    = 56.78 </br>
soil = 12.34 </br>
salt = 1.23 </br>
lux = 456.78 </br>
bat = 3.70 </br>
HTTP Response code : 200 </br>
